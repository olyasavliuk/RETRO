    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Olya. I`m 25 years old. I live in Ivano-Frankivsk. I`m interested in mountains trips, maybe it`s because my city is situated near the 
      Carpathians. My career was started at 2017 in the small company. Since that time I was working as 
      —Åoordinator of the service center for maintenance of heating appliances. Now I`m understand that I don`t like my job and I want to do something that I like. So, that`s why I decided to try myself as a developer. Hope it will be successfull.</p>

    <h3>Joker</h3>
    <p>My favourite movie is Joker. It is about: in Gotham City, mentally troubled comedian Arthur Fleck is disregarded and mistreated by society. He then embarks on a downward spiral of revolution and bloody crime. This path brings him face-to-face with his alter-ego: the Joker. </p>
